# CookHelper

An Android application.

## Coding Standards
1. No broken shit in `master`.

## Things To Do:
1. Restrict users from typing `|` verticle pole(s) and ``` ` ``` backtick(s) into ANY text field
2. RecipeView (not started)
3. EditRecipe (almost done: need to fix deletion of ingredients/types/categories)
