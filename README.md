# CookHelper

An Android application.

## Coding Standards

1. Any front end element's (Button, TextView, Spinner, etc) accompanying back end connector method (OnClick, etc) must be written a certain way. For buttons, for example, the `id` of a button should be `add_recipe_btn` and it's accompanying `OnClick` method should be the *SAME* thing *EXCEPT* you prepend `On_` before it. In this case, it would be `On_add_recipe_btn`.

2. No broken shit in `master`.
